# Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks,how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
For the actual task evaluation of CP1404 course, 
by conducting homework exercises with different content every week 
and listening to the professor's online recorded courses, 
I have gained a deeper understanding of Python as a computer language.
In the process of learning, it is inevitable that there will be code errors, 
but after more practice, asking classmates, and searching for information online, 
gradually improving the accuracy of my own code writing. 
Through this course, 
have learned a lot of computer languages and greatly improved the accuracy of my own code writing.

# Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- As the subject of review:
Code review provides opportunities to improve coding skills, learn best practices, and understand different methods.
Clearly communicate the purpose and functionality of the code in the pull request description.
Different team members may have different perspectives, and code review is an opportunity to benefit from collective knowledge.
Improve your coding practices over time and strive to avoid similar issues in future contributions.
- As a reviewer:
Provide balanced feedback, highlighting positive and improvement aspects. Praise well written code and good practices.
Remember that code review is a collaborative process with the goal of improving the code.
Can share knowledge and best practices. Encourage discussion and collaboration. 
Code review is not only about identifying issues, but also about creating an environment that promotes learning among team members.
As examinees and reviewers, work together to improve code quality, share knowledge, 
and build a stronger and more cohesive development team.

# Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
If I were responsible for this topic, I would advocate for more teamwork and personal thinking. 
Prioritize personal thinking, and the content of collaboration is to wait for individuals to complete the solution, 
combine the ideas of multiple people, and have more methods to address the problem, which facilitates the expansion of students' knowledge. 
Expand the task requirements slightly, giving students the motivation to learn new knowledge and a sense of achievement after customer service challenges
